\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-author, Alejandro Aceves, I would like to submit the article ``Standing Wave Solutions in Twisted Multicore Fibers'' for consideration of publication in Physical Review A. In this work, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of standing wave solutions in a mathematical model of a twisted, multi-core optical fiber. This paper has not been submitted elsewhere.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
